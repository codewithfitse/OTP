## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

-   Node.js (v14 or higher)
-   npm or yarn
-   An Appwrite instance (cloud or self-hosted)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/codewithfitse/OTP
cd cd OTP
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory using the example template:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then update the values in `.env`:

```env
APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1
APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>
```

4. Set up Appwrite:

    - Create a new project in your Appwrite console
    - Enable phone authentication in your project settings
    - Copy your project ID to the `.env` file

5. Start the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application should now be running at `http://localhost:5173`
